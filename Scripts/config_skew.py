Scripts/config_skew.py — inputs for Scripts/skew_calibrate_systematic.py and
Scripts/skew_calibrate_idiosyncratic.py.

Mirrors the systematic- and idiosyncratic-stage calibration cells in
Scripts/skew_calibration_kimyi2025.ipynb, but as a set of editable knobs
instead of hard-coded notebook constants, so the calibration can be re-run
from the command line and incrementally extended to new dates.

This file is the *source of truth* for which underlyings the pipeline
calibrates. Adding a new idiosyncratic name is a one-place edit:

    IDIOSYNCRATIC_UNDERLYINGS["AAPL"] = {
        "dividend_yield_pct": 0.5,
        "data_path": None,
        "display_name": "Apple Inc.",
    }

Scripts/load_portfolio.get_idiosyncratic_ids() reads from
IDIOSYNCRATIC_UNDERLYINGS below, so downstream P-MLE / VaR / collar-analysis
code picks up the new name automatically -- no other file has to change.

This module has NO imports from application code (Scripts/, Library/, Study/):
those modules import from here, not the other way round. That inversion is
what lets IDIOSYNCRATIC_UNDERLYINGS be the single source of truth.

Edit these values to point at real data / a new sample window; the
calibration logic in the scripts themselves should not need to change.
