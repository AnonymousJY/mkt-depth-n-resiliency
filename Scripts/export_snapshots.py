"""
export_snapshots.py — freeze live data sources into committed snapshots.

Run this ONCE, in an environment that has network access, to turn the
repository into a self-contained replication package. After it runs, every
analysis script and notebook works in the default ``snapshot`` data mode with
no network dependency, and the published tables and figures become exactly
reproducible.

    python Scripts/export_snapshots.py

Outputs (written under ``data/snapshots/``)
-------------------------------------------
    prices_SPX.csv      adjusted-close history for the systematic proxy
    prices_COIN.csv     adjusted-close history for each idiosyncratic asset

Notes
-----
* Price history is pulled from FinanceDataReader. Vendor history is revised
  over time, so the committed snapshot is the single source of truth for
  reproducibility once frozen.
* The P-MLE parameter estimates are not exported here — they already ship as
  per-date CSVs under ``Study/Estimated Parameters PMLE/`` and are produced
  directly by ``Scripts/run_pmle_kimyi2025.py``.
* The portfolio definition is produced by ``Scripts/load_portfolio.py``
  (``build_portfolio()`` / ``data/snapshots/portfolio.csv``); it requires no
  external data source.
